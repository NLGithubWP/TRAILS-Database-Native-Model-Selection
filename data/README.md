NB101:
    There are exactly 423,624 computationally unique modules within this search space and each one has been trained for 4, 12, 36, and 108 epochs three times each (423K * 3 * 4 = ~5M total trained models). We report the following metrics:
    training accuracy
    validation accuracy
    testing accuracy
    number of parameters
    training time
